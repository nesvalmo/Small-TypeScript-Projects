# Description
This is Opaline. My simple open source to-do list written in TypeScript as a means to learn TS.

## Features
 - Add tasks
 - Complete tasks
 - View and restore previous tasks
 - Automatically capture the task completion date
 - Mouse-free functionality (use 'A' to add tasks, the input is automatically focused on)

## Known bugs/Lacks of feature
 - It looks pretty dirty when the task title is too long
 - The "due date" is not a proper date, just a string that allows the user to write whatever they want, you can look at it as a feature that allows the user to be flexible (yes I'm for real)
 - Lacks data persistence. If you refresh the page, your tasks are gone. (This is a deal breaker, I'll fix it sometime soon)
